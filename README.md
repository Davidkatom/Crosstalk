# Quantum Computing Ramsey Experiments Simulation

This Python script is designed for simulating Ramsey experiments in quantum computing, utilizing IBM's Qiskit framework. It provides a comprehensive setup for running simulations, analyzing data, and extracting meaningful results from quantum experiments.

## Features

- Simulation of Ramsey experiments using Qiskit.
- Integration with IBM Quantum services.
- Functions for calculating effective Hamiltonians and energy levels.
- Handling of quantum noise and decay in simulations.
- Advanced data analysis techniques including FFT and curve fitting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- IBM Quantum account (for accessing IBM's quantum computers)

## Setup

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```
2. Set up an IBM Quantum account and retrieve your API token.

3. Insert your IBM Quantum token in the script.

## Usage

The script can be run as a standard Python script. Ensure you have set up your IBM Quantum account and token correctly.

```bash
python ramsey_experiments.py
```

## Structure

### `h(n, J, z)`
A function to calculate Hamiltonian-related values. It computes the Hamiltonian of a quantum system based on input parameters.

### `effective_hem(size, J, W)`
A function to compute the effective Hamiltonian matrix for a given quantum system. It utilizes size, coupling constants, and other parameters to determine the matrix.

### `RamseyExperiment`
A class for setting up and running a Ramsey experiment simulation. Key functionalities include:
- Creating quantum circuits for the experiment.
- Running simulations with or without quantum noise.
- Analyzing the results of the experiment, including the extraction of relevant quantum states.

### `RamseyBatch`
A class for managing batches of `RamseyExperiment` instances and performing collective data analysis. This includes:
- Aggregating results from multiple experiments.
- Applying data processing techniques such as low-pass filtering and Fourier transforms.
- Curve fitting and model comparison to draw conclusions from the data.
